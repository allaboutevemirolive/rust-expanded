The code compiles because it introduces explicit lifetime parameters in the associated types and function definition to handle the lifetime relationships correctly. The key changes are:

1. Introducing a common lifetime `'both`: The code introduces a common lifetime parameter `'both`, which is used in all the associated types and the function definition. This common lifetime parameter ensures that all the involved lifetimes are related, allowing them to be used together without any conflicts.

2. Lifetime bounds in the associated type `Future`: The associated type `Future` now has explicit lifetime bounds, which are `'iter: 'both` and `'future: 'both`. These bounds indicate that `'iter` and `'future` must both outlive the common lifetime `'both`. This ensures that the lifetimes of the iterator and the future returned are compatible and do not lead to any hidden type capturing errors.

3. Lifetime bounds in the function `get_iter`: The function `get_iter` also has explicit lifetime bounds, `'iter: 'both` and `'future: 'both`, applied to the lifetimes of `&'iter self` and `&'future ()` parameters. This ensures that both the `self` and `arg` references live at least as long as the common lifetime `'both`.

By introducing these explicit lifetime parameters and specifying the appropriate bounds, the code ensures that all involved lifetimes are well-formed and properly related, allowing the `impl Trait` syntax to work correctly. The compiler can now determine the correct lifetimes for the associated types, making the code compile successfully without any hidden type capturing errors.
