```rust
struct C;

struct B<'b> {
    c: &'b C,
}

struct A<'a> {
    b: B<'a>,
    c: &'a C,
}

impl<'a> A<'a> {
    fn new(c: &'a C) -> A<'a> {
        A {
            c: c,
            b: B { c: c },
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c1 = C;
    let _ = A::new(&c1);
}
```




## Motivation



```
So rust tracking lifetime for struct is different from tracking lifetime for function?
```


Yes, in Rust, the tracking of lifetimes for structs and functions is different. The key difference lies in how lifetimes are associated with their respective elements and how they are used to ensure memory safety.

1. Lifetimes in Structs:
   - When you define a struct with lifetime parameters, each field of the struct can have its own distinct lifetime associated with it.
   - The lifetimes of the fields are independent of each other, and they can have different durations based on their scope and usage.
   - The lifetime of the struct itself is defined by the shortest lifetime among the lifetime parameters used in the struct's fields. This ensures that the struct cannot outlive any of its fields.
   - When you create an instance of a struct with references as fields, the lifetimes of those references must be compatible with the lifetime of the struct.

2. Lifetimes in Functions:
   - Functions with lifetime parameters have a more rigid lifetime tracking mechanism compared to structs.
   - When a function has multiple lifetime parameters, Rust enforces that all input references with different lifetimes must have a relationship that satisfies the borrowing rules.
   - The lifetimes of input references are constrained to ensure they are valid throughout the function's execution. The output references must have a lifetime that is tied to the input lifetimes or be `'static` if they are not bound to any input references.
   - Unlike structs, functions do not have their own lifetime. Instead, the lifetime relationships between input and output references are determined based on the lifetime parameters.

In summary, Rust's lifetime system is designed to ensure memory safety by preventing dangling references and data races. While both structs and functions can use lifetime parameters, the way lifetimes are tracked and enforced is different. Structs can have fields with distinct lifetimes, and the lifetime of the struct itself is derived from the shortest lifetime among the fields. On the other hand, functions with lifetime parameters enforce relationships between input and output references to guarantee safe memory access and prevent use-after-free errors.
