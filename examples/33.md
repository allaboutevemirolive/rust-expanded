Cannot borrow mutable data multiple time in iteration

# TOPIC: Multiple mutable borrow cannot coexistence in same scope


There are several workarounds we can do, but implementing them might require extra knowledge. We might want to refer to the reference above.



Implementation to workaround this limitation that is tested and works. Here's a summary of the scenarios when you might consider using each approach:

1. **Use Immutable Borrows:**
   - When you only need to read data and don't intend to modify it.
   - When you want to access data from multiple parts of your code without worrying about mutable references.

2. **Clone:**
   - When the data is clonable and you need independent copies for separate operations.
   - When you're working with small data that can be efficiently cloned.
   - When you want to avoid complex mutable borrowing scenarios.
   - Disadvantage: Cloning can be expensive in terms of memory and performance, especially for large data structures.

3. **Unsafe Code:**
   - When you fully understand the implications of bypassing the borrow checker's restrictions.
   - When you need to implement complex data structures that require multiple mutable references.
   - When you're working on low-level code where the performance benefits outweigh the risks.
   - Disadvantage: Unsafe code can lead to memory unsafety and undefined behavior if used incorrectly.

4. **Option::take:**
   - When you can temporarily replace the data with `None` and later replace it back with a new value.
   - When you need a mutable reference for a specific operation but can revert to the original state afterward.
   - When the data is not clonable but can be safely replaced temporarily.
   - Disadvantage: This approach requires changing the structure of the data to accommodate the `Option` wrapper.

5. **Interior Mutability:**
   - When you need to mutate data behind an immutable reference.
   - When using `Cell`, `RefCell`, or `Mutex` is more practical than other options.
   - When runtime checks for borrow violations are acceptable.
   - Disadvantage: These types come with runtime overhead and the potential for runtime panics if the borrowing rules are violated.

6. **Reorganizing Code:** Sometimes, reorganizing your code can help you avoid the need for multiple mutable references. You might consider splitting your functions into smaller pieces that operate on different parts of the data.

7. **Redesign Data Structures:** If possible, you could redesign your data structures to minimize the need for multiple mutable references. Sometimes, a different data organization can simplify the borrow checker's job.

Same problem but with iteration:


COMPILE ERROR!

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo {}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Bar2<'b> {
    x: &'b Foo,
}

impl<'b> Bar2<'b> {
    fn f(&'b mut self) -> &'b Foo {
        self.x
    }
}

fn f4() {
    let foo = Foo {};
    let mut bar2 = Bar2 { x: &foo }; 

    // We also can't calls mutable data in iteration
    for i in 0..10{
        bar2.f();
    }
}

fn main() {}
```


The error and warning you're encountering are related to Rust's borrowing and ownership rules. The Rust compiler is preventing you from borrowing a mutable reference to `bar2` multiple times within the same scope, as this would lead to potential issues with data races or other mutable reference violations.

Let's break down what's happening in your code:

1. You define a struct `Foo` and a struct `Bar2` that holds a mutable reference to a `Foo`.
2. You implement a method `f` for `Bar2` that returns a mutable reference to the stored `Foo`.
3. In the `f4` function, you create an instance of `Foo` named `foo`.
4. You create a mutable instance of `Bar2` named `bar2` that references the `foo` instance.
5. You call the `f` method on `bar2`, which borrows `bar2` mutably.
6. You immediately try to call the `f` method on `bar2` again, attempting to borrow it mutably a second time.

The issue arises from step 6. In Rust, you cannot have multiple mutable references to the same data within the same scope. This is to prevent data races and ensure memory safety.

To fix this issue, you need to restructure your code so that you're not attempting to borrow `bar2` mutably twice within the same scope. Depending on your actual use case, you might need to rethink your design to avoid such situations.

If you genuinely need to access `bar2`'s contents twice with mutable references, you might consider making a clone or creating another mutable reference after the first mutable reference goes out of scope.

Remember that Rust's ownership and borrowing rules are designed to ensure memory safety, and working within these rules will help you write safe and robust code.



```
So the problem is that I try to borrow mutable data multiple times, which can lead to data races? If I borrow immutable data multiple times, then the compiler will not complain since it does not lead to data races?
```


Yes, you've understood correctly.

In Rust, borrowing mutable data multiple times within the same scope can lead to data races. Data races occur when multiple threads access the same data concurrently, and at least one of them performs a write operation. These situations can lead to unpredictable behavior and memory corruption.

Rust's borrow checker enforces strict rules to prevent data races and ensure memory safety. When you have mutable borrows (also known as mutable references) to the same data, Rust will prevent you from having more than one mutable borrow in the same scope. This ensures that the data is only modified by one thread at a time.

On the other hand, borrowing immutable data (immutable references) multiple times is allowed because it doesn't pose the same risk of data races. Immutable borrows can coexist because they only allow reading data, and reading data simultaneously from multiple threads doesn't introduce conflicts.

So, the Rust compiler is quite intelligent in its analysis of borrowing and ownership, helping you write concurrent and safe code without data race vulnerabilities.
