1. What are associated types in Rust, and why are they used?



Associated types are a feature in Rust that allow for the definition of type aliases within a trait. They are used to group types together and improve code readability by moving inner types locally into a trait as output types[1]. Associated types are declared within a trait using the `type` keyword and are used to connect a type placeholder with a trait so that the trait method definitions can use these placeholder types in their signatures[5]. 

Associated types are used when it makes sense to group types together[2]. They are a powerful part of Rust's type system and are related to the idea of a 'type family', in other words, grouping multiple types together[7]. Associated types are mainly used for connecting various placeholders to traits so that the trait methods can use the placeholders without needing to know exactly what those types are until the trait is implemented[5]. 

The syntax for the trait definition with associated types is as follows[1]:
```rs
trait Contains {
    type A;
    type B;
    fn contains(&self, _: &Self::A, _: &Self::B) -> bool;
}
```
Functions that use the trait `Contains` are no longer required to express `A` or `B` at all[1]:
```rs
// Without using associated types
fn difference<A, B, C>(container: &C) -> i32 where C: Contains<A, B> {
    ...
}

// Using associated types
fn difference<C: Contains>(container: &C) -> i32 {
    ...
}
```
Associated types may include generic parameters and where clauses, which are often referred to as generic associated types, or GATs[3]. 

Associated types are used to group the data types that can be in the different implementation using structs. But using generics, we have to write separate implementations for each type[6]. Associated types are more flexible than generics and can be considered as a shorthand syntax for generics[6]. 

In Rust 1.65, a new feature called generic associated types (GATs) was introduced, which allows developers to specify generics on associated types in traits[9]. GATs can be thought of as a form of type constructors on traits and can be used to define generic type, lifetime, or const generics on associated types[9]. 

In summary, associated types are a powerful feature in Rust that allow for the definition of type aliases within a trait. They are used to group types together and improve code readability by moving inner types locally into a trait as output types. They are mainly used for connecting various placeholders to traits so that the trait methods can use the placeholders without needing to know exactly what those types are until the trait is implemented.
