Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (HRTBs) is a feature in Rust that allows for more flexible and expressive trait bounds. HRTBs are used to specify trait bounds that are true for all lifetimes, or for all possible choices of a lifetime. This feature is particularly useful when working with closures, as it allows for more generic and reusable code. HRTBs are implemented using the `for<>` syntax, which is called a higher-ranked trait bound. 

The `for<>` syntax is used to specify a trait bound that is true for all possible choices of a lifetime. For example, `for<'a> T: Trait<&'a i32>` specifies that `T` implements `Trait` for any lifetime `'a` and a reference to an `i32`. This syntax is used to specify HRTBs for lifetimes. Rust does not currently support HRTBs for types, but this may be added in the future.

HRTBs are a relatively advanced feature in Rust, and they can be used to write more generic and reusable code.
