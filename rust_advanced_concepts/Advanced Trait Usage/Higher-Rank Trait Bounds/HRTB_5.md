Correct my intuition, in rust, constrain normally use for trait or something, but with hrtb, we can extand the constrain to function. 

Normal constraint: 
F is implemented with Clone trait

HRTB: 
F is implemented with functions that take parameters and return a type.
```


Your intuition is mostly correct, but let's clarify and expand upon it:

In Rust, constraints are used to specify requirements that a generic type must fulfill. These constraints are often expressed through trait bounds. Traits define a set of behaviors that types can implement. For example, the `Clone` trait represents the ability to create a copy of a value.

In the context of trait bounds, here's how you would express those two scenarios you mentioned:

**Normal Constraint - Using Traits:**
```rust
fn example<T: Clone>(value: T) {
    // Here, T must implement the Clone trait.
    // You can call value.clone() inside the function.
}
```

**HRTB Constraint - Extending to Functions:**
```rust
fn example<F>(func: F)
where
    F: for<'a> Fn(&'a str),
{
    // Here, F is required to be a function/closure that takes a reference to a string slice.
    // This is an example of using HRTBs to constrain functions.
}
```

So, in your explanation:

- **Normal Constraint:** You're correct that you typically use trait bounds to constrain generic types. For instance, `T: Clone` means the generic type `T` must implement the `Clone` trait.

- **HRTB Constraint:** With Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (HRTBs), you can extend these constraints to functions or closures. In your example, `F: for<'a> Fn(&'a str)` means that `F` must be a function or closure that can accept a reference to a string slice as an argument. This is a more flexible form of constraint, allowing you to specify requirements on functions and their behavior rather than just types.

In summary, HRTBs allow you to constrain not just the types themselves, but also the behaviors of functions and closures that use those types. This added flexibility can be particularly useful in scenarios where you want to work with functions that have specific input or output patterns, enabling more abstract and versatile code.
