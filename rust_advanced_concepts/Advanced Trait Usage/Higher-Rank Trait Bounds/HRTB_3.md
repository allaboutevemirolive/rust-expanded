Sure, here's an example of Rust code that uses Higher-Rank Trait Bounds (HRTBs):

```rust
fn main() {
    let closure: Box<dyn for<'a> Fn(&'a str)> = Box::new(|s| {
        println!("Length of the string: {}", s.len());
    });

    apply_closure(closure);
}

fn apply_closure<F>(func: F)
where
    F: for<'a> Fn(&'a str),
{
    let s = "HRTBs example";
    func(s);
}
```

In this example, we have a `closure` that is a trait object implementing the `Fn` trait for any lifetime `'a`. The `apply_closure` function takes any function implementing the `Fn` trait for any lifetime `'a`, and then it applies the function to a string slice.

This demonstrates how you can use HRTBs to work with higher-rank trait bounds, allowing for greater flexibility when working with functions and trait objects involving different lifetimes.
