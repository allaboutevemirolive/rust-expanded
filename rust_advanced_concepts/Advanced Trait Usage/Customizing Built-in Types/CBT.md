Customizing built-in types in Rust often involves implementing traits for those types. Here's an exhaustive list of traits that you can implement to customize various built-in types in Rust:

**1. PartialEq and Eq**
   - `PartialEq`: For implementing equality comparisons (`==`).
   - `Eq`: For implementing structural equality comparisons.

**2. PartialOrd and Ord**
   - `PartialOrd`: For implementing partial ordering comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
   - `Ord`: For implementing total ordering comparisons.

**3. Clone**
   - `Clone`: For implementing explicit cloning of values.

**4. Copy**
   - `Copy`: For types that have "trivial" copies, allowing them to be copied implicitly.

**5. Default**
   - `Default`: For providing a default value for types.

**6. Debug**
   - `Debug`: For implementing the `fmt::Debug` trait, used for formatting debug output.

**7. Display**
   - `Display`: For implementing the `fmt::Display` trait, used for formatting user-friendly output.

**8. Hash**
   - `Hash`: For implementing the `std::hash::Hash` trait, used for hashing values for use in hash maps and sets.

**9. Iterator**
   - `Iterator`: For creating custom iterators over your types.

**10. IntoIterator**
    - `IntoIterator`: For converting your type into an iterator.

**11. From and Into**
    - `From`: For converting from another type into your type.
    - `Into`: For converting from your type into another type.

**12. Deref and DerefMut**
    - `Deref`: For implementing dereferencing behavior.
    - `DerefMut`: For implementing mutable dereferencing behavior.

**13. AsRef and AsMut**
    - `AsRef`: For providing a reference-to-self conversion.
    - `AsMut`: For providing a mutable reference-to-self conversion.

**14. Default and DefaultMut**
    - `Default`: For getting a reference to a default value.
    - `DefaultMut`: For getting a mutable reference to a default value.

**15. Index and IndexMut**
    - `Index`: For implementing indexing (`[]`) operations.
    - `IndexMut`: For implementing mutable indexing operations.

**16. Drop**
    - `Drop`: For implementing custom cleanup behavior when a value goes out of scope.

**17. Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce**
    - `Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`: For implementing function-like behavior on your types.

**18. Send and Sync**
    - `Send`: For marking types that can be safely transferred between threads.
    - `Sync`: For marking types that can be safely shared between threads.

**19. Unpin**
    - `Unpin`: For indicating that a type can be safely moved after being pinned in memory.

Remember that implementing these traits can greatly enhance the capabilities of your custom types and make them more versatile and compatible with various Rust idioms and libraries. The choice of which traits to implement depends on the behavior you want your custom types to have and the contexts in which they will be used.
