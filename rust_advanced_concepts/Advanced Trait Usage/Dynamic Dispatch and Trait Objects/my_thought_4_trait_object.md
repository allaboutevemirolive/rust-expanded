When we talk about "dynamic dispatch" and "trait objects" in the context of Rust, a `"trait object"` refers to 

> a reference (or pointer) to an instance of a type that implements a specific trait. 

This allows you to treat objects of different types that implement the same trait as if they were of the same type, enabling runtime polymorphism and dynamic dispatch.

Here's a breakdown of the terms:

- **Dynamic Dispatch**: This refers to the process of selecting and invoking a specific implementation of a trait method at runtime. The exact implementation to be called is determined based on the actual type of the trait object during program execution.

- **Trait Object**: A trait object is created by taking a reference (or pointer) to a concrete instance of a type that implements a trait. This reference is then treated as an "object" that adheres to the trait's interface. The trait object allows you to invoke trait methods on the reference without knowing the exact concrete type of the object.

Using trait objects and dynamic dispatch, you can write code that operates on different types in a unified manner, as long as they share the same trait. This provides runtime flexibility and promotes code reusability by allowing you to work with various types through a common interface.

In the context of your original question and the provided code examples, the "trait object" is the reference to the trait (`&dyn Processor`) that is treated as a common object reference in dynamic dispatch. This reference allows you to call trait methods on different types implementing the `Processor` trait.
