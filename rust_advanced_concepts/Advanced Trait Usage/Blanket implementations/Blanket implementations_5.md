```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn do_something(&self);
}

impl<T: MyTrait> MyTrait for &T {
    fn do_something(&self) {
        T::do_something(*self);

    let my_ref = &my_obj;
    
    my_ref.do_something();  // This will print "MyStruct is doing something!"

CODE 2:

```rust

## QUESTION:

In Rust, why does, 
`version 1` not need a reference in `T::do_something(*self);` 
while 
`version 2` needs a reference in `T::do_something(&*self);`?


Version 1:

```rust
impl<T: MyTrait> MyTrait for &T {
    fn do_something(&self) {
        T::do_something(*self);
    }
}
```

Version 2:

```rust
impl<T: MyTrait> MyTrait for Box<T> {
    fn do_something(&self) {
        T::do_something(&*self);
    }
}
```


## ANSWER:


In Rust, the distinction between Version 1 and Version 2 lies in the specific types of the receiver objects involved in each implementation. The differences stem from Rust's inherent traits, reference behavior, and smart pointer dereferencing.

**Version 1:**

```rust
impl<T: MyTrait> MyTrait for &T {
    fn do_something(&self) {
        T::do_something(*self);
    }
}
```

In Version 1, you are implementing `MyTrait` for references `&T`. Since the receiver object is already a reference, dereferencing it before calling the method is not necessary. The reference itself represents the value, so when invoking `T::do_something(*self)`, you're passing the value pointed to by the reference.

**Version 2:**

```rust
impl<T: MyTrait> MyTrait for Box<T> {
    fn do_something(&self) {
        T::do_something(&*self);
    }
}
```

In Version 2, you are implementing `MyTrait` for `Box<T>`. A `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that automatically implements the `Deref` trait, allowing you to treat the box as if it were a reference to the inner value. This behavior is known as "deref coercion," where the compiler automatically inserts dereference operations to make method calls work seamlessly. However, when you want to explicitly reference the inner value, you need to dereference the box and then create a reference to the inner value.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. `*self`: This dereferences the `Box<T>` to access the inner value of type `T`.

2. `&*self`: After dereferencing, you're creating a reference to the inner value of type `T`.

3. `T::do_something(&*self)`: This line is now calling the method `do_something` from the `MyTrait` trait on the inner value, passing a reference to it.

Rust's strict rules regarding references and lifetimes are aimed at ensuring memory safety. This includes preventing mutable references from aliasing each other, which can lead to data races. Deref coercion, although useful, can sometimes lead to confusion or unexpected behavior. Therefore, understanding when and how deref coercion occurs is crucial to writing safe and predictable code.

In conclusion, the difference between Version 1 and Version 2 arises from the nature of the receiver objects and Rust's automatic dereferencing behavior. In Version 1, you're working directly with references, while in Version 2, you're utilizing the automatic dereferencing capabilities of `Box<T>` and explicitly referencing the inner value. Rust's design choices prioritize safety and predictability, making it essential to comprehend how references and smart pointers behave in different scenarios.
