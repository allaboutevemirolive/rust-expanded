> What is bootstrapping in rust


Bootstrapping in Rust refers to the process of building the Rust compiler using an existing version of the compiler. It involves using a previously compiled and stable version of the Rust compiler to compile the source code of the Rust compiler itself. The resulting compiler is then used to compile subsequent versions of the Rust compiler, creating a self-hosted compiler.

The bootstrapping process is an important part of Rust's development and maintenance. It ensures that each new version of the Rust compiler is built using a known and trusted version, providing a reliable and reproducible way to update the language and its tooling.

Bootstrapping is necessary because the Rust compiler is primarily written in Rust itself. To compile the Rust compiler, you need a working compiler that understands Rust syntax and semantics. The initial version of the compiler is typically written in a different language (often OCaml), but as Rust evolves, the goal is to have the compiler written in Rust entirely.

The bootstrapping process involves several steps:

1. **Stage 0**: The initial version of the Rust compiler is written in a language like OCaml. It can parse and compile Rust source code written in earlier versions of the language.

2. **Stage 1**: Using the Stage 0 compiler, the source code of the Rust compiler written in Rust is compiled. This generates an executable binary for the Rust compiler.

3. **Stage 2**: The Stage 1 compiler is used to compile the Rust compiler source code again, resulting in a new version of the Rust compiler. This newly generated compiler is functionally equivalent to the Stage 1 compiler but is implemented in Rust.

4. **Stage 3**: The Stage 2 compiler is used to compile the Rust compiler once again, creating yet another version. This process can be repeated multiple times to ensure stability and catch any issues that may arise.

Each stage in the bootstrapping process serves as a building block for the subsequent stage. Once the self-hosted compiler is obtained, it becomes the foundation for further development, enabling the Rust language and compiler to evolve and improve over time.

In summary, bootstrapping in Rust is the process of compiling the Rust compiler using an existing version of the compiler, gradually transitioning from an initial version written in a different language to a self-hosted version implemented entirely in Rust.


> Why was the first compiler written in OCaml and not advanced languages like C++?

The choice to initially write the Rust compiler in OCaml, rather than advanced languages like C++, was driven by a combination of factors, including the language's characteristics and the specific goals and requirements of the Rust project. Here are some reasons why OCaml was chosen:

1. **Expressive Type System**: OCaml is a statically typed functional programming language with a powerful type system. It provides advanced type inference capabilities, pattern matching, and algebraic data types, which made it well-suited for implementing the complex type system and semantic analysis required by the Rust language.

2. **Concurrency and Safety**: One of the key objectives of the Rust language is to provide memory safety and strong concurrency guarantees. OCaml has a reputation for being a safe and reliable language with good support for concurrency through its lightweight threads and synchronous message passing mechanisms. This made it a suitable choice for implementing the early versions of the Rust compiler, as it aligned well with the project's goals.

3. **Developer Familiarity**: The initial developers of Rust had experience and expertise in OCaml. They were comfortable working with the language and understood its strengths and limitations. This familiarity with OCaml made it a natural choice for implementing the initial version of the Rust compiler.

4. **Prototype and Experimentation**: Using OCaml initially allowed the Rust developers to quickly prototype and experiment with language features and compiler design choices. OCaml's concise syntax and expressive type system facilitated rapid development and iteration, enabling the Rust team to explore different language designs and refine the compiler implementation.

While the decision to start with OCaml was practical for the early stages of the Rust project, the long-term goal was always to write the compiler in Rust itself. This transition to self-hosting was a significant milestone in the evolution of Rust and demonstrated the language's maturity and suitability for systems programming.

It's worth noting that as Rust has grown in popularity, the development community has embraced writing tools and libraries in Rust. Today, the Rust compiler is written almost entirely in Rust, which showcases the language's capabilities and emphasizes the goal of self-hosting.


> But if expressiveness is one of the choices, why not use Python, which is general-purpose?

While Python is a popular general-purpose programming language known for its expressiveness and ease of use, it may not have been the ideal choice for implementing the initial version of the Rust compiler. Here are a few reasons why Python might not have been selected:

1. **Performance**: Rust aims to be a systems programming language with a strong focus on performance and low-level control. Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language with a runtime that introduces additional overhead. Writing the Rust compiler in Python could have resulted in a significant performance penalty, which would be undesirable for a compiler itself.

2. **Static Typing**: Rust is designed with a strong emphasis on static typing and compile-time safety checks. Python, in contrast, is dynamically typed, meaning type errors are often detected at runtime. Implementing a language with Rust's type system and static guarantees in a dynamically typed language like Python would introduce challenges and potentially sacrifice some of the language's core features.

3. **Concurrency**: Rust places a strong emphasis on safe concurrency, and its ownership system and borrowing rules enable fine-grained control over memory and thread safety. While Python does offer libraries for concurrency, it does not have the same level of built-in support for concurrent programming as Rust does.

4. **Tooling Ecosystem**: Rust has a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries, including those related to compiler development and static analysis. By implementing the compiler in Rust, the language itself can be used to build and leverage these tools effectively, creating a self-contained ecosystem that supports the language's goals.

5. **Developer Familiarity**: The initial developers of Rust had experience and expertise in OCaml, which played a role in the choice of using OCaml for the initial implementation. Similarly, familiarity with the Rust language itself was a goal for the long-term development of the project. Using Python would have required a shift in development practices and tooling for the Rust project.

It's important to note that while Python may not have been chosen for the initial implementation of the Rust compiler, Python can still be used as a scripting language alongside Rust, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of both languages in their projects.

Ultimately, the choice of a language for implementing a compiler involves considering multiple factors such as performance, type system, concurrency support, existing tooling, developer expertise, and alignment with the language's goals and design principles.
