> Explanation:


The code you provided has a couple of issues that are causing compilation errors.

1. `'static` lifetime on a string literal: In the line `let shorter_lifetime: 'static str = String::from("Hello");`, you are trying to assign a string literal `"Hello"` to a variable with the `'static` lifetime. However, string literals already have the `'static` lifetime by default, so you don't need to specify it explicitly. You can simply write `let shorter_lifetime = "Hello";` to assign the string literal to the variable.

2. Passing mismatched lifetimes: In the `print_length` function call, you are trying to pass `shorter_lifetime` (which has a `'static` lifetime) and `&s2` (which has a shorter lifetime determined by the scope of `main`). The lifetimes of the arguments must match, or one should be a subset of the other. In this case, since `shorter_lifetime` has a longer lifetime than `&s2`, you can't pass them directly. If you want to pass both variables to the function, you need to adjust the lifetimes accordingly.


> Solution:

```rust
fn print_length(s1: &str, s2: &str) {
    println!("Lengths: {}, {}", s1.len(), s2.len());
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello");
    let s2 = String::from("World");

    print_length(&s1, &s2);
}
```

> Explanation:

The code you provided has a lifetime error. The error message is indicating that the variable `s1` does not live long enough to satisfy the `'static` lifetime requirement imposed by the type annotation on `shorter_lifetime`.

In the `main` function, you create two `String` objects, `s1` and `s2`, which have different lifetimes. The `s1` string is created and stored on the stack, and then you take a reference to it using `&s1`. However, you're trying to assign this reference to a variable `shorter_lifetime` with the type annotation `&'static str`, which means that the reference should have a `'static` lifetime, meaning it should live for the entire duration of the program.

The error occurs because the lifetime of `s1` is limited to the scope of the `main` function, and it is dropped at the end of the function. But the reference `shorter_lifetime` is expected to live for the entire program, which is not possible since `s1` will be deallocated after `main` finishes.

To fix this error, you need to ensure that the reference `shorter_lifetime` has a lifetime that is at least as long as the strings `s1` and `s2`. One possible solution is to change the type of `shorter_lifetime` to `&str` instead of `&'static str`:

PLEASE REFER CODE_4

```rust
fn print_length<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) {
    println!("Lengths: {}, {}", s1.len(), s2.len());
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello");
    let s2 = String::from("World");
    let shorter_lifetime: &str = &s1;

    print_length(shorter_lifetime, &s2);
}
```

By removing the `'static` lifetime requirement, the reference `shorter_lifetime` can now have the same lifetime as `s1`, and the code will compile without errors.

My own thoughts:

In Rust, when a variable or item is created within a certain scope, it exists only within that scope. Each item also has its own lifespan, which means it will be automatically removed or dropped when its scope ends. This rule applies to functions as well.

To prevent the Rust compiler from dropping a variable or item prematurely, we need to use the "lifetime parameter" in the function. By specifying the lifetime parameter, we tell the compiler that the input to the function should not be dropped.

It's important to note that the lifetime of the input is the same as the lifetime of the output in this context.

Since different inputs may have different lifetimes, we need to specify different lifetimes for each item to ensure their proper management and prevent any premature dropping.

Rust uses a strict ownership and borrowing model to ensure memory safety and prevent common programming errors like data races and dangling references.

In Rust, each item or variable has its own scope and lifetime. When the scope ends, the item is dropped, which means its memory is freed. This rule applies to variables within functions as well.

To ensure that variables are not dropped prematurely, you can use the "lifetime parameter" in function signatures. By specifying the lifetime parameter, you tell the Rust compiler how long the input variables should live and prevent them from being dropped too early.

It's worth noting that in Rust, the lifetime of the input variables is tied to the lifetime of the output variables in certain cases, especially when working with references. Different inputs may have different lifetimes, and specifying the correct lifetimes for each item is essential to ensure correct and safe code.

Overall, your understanding aligns with the fundamental concepts of Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
